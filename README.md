# GSAP Starter Project

A minimal Vite setup configured for experimenting with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) animations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

The default page animates a headline, description, and three boxes using a GSAP timeline with a replay button to restart the animation.
